# Questions

1. Create a function that takes an unlimited amount of number parameters, and returns an array of all the permutations possible. For example, `myFunction(4, 7, 2) {}` should return `[472, 427, 724, 742, 247, 274]`.

2. Create a function that can find the Nth smallest number in an array. The array can be very very big, so you are not allowed using the `Array.sort()` method. Try to build a function that would perform fast. Also, explain why using `Array.sort()` isn't a good idea when sorting large arrays.
